# Frontend README for Fullstack Website

# Frontend Documentation

This directory contains the frontend application for the Fullstack Website project. The frontend is built using React and communicates with the backend to process user input.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React application and open it in your default web browser.

## Usage

The frontend application provides a simple interface for users to input a comma-separated list of numbers ranging from 1 to 210, with a maximum of 51 numbers. Once the input is submitted, the application sends the data to the backend for processing.

## Folder Structure

- `public/`: Contains the static files for the application, including `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the React components and application logic.
- `package.json`: Contains the metadata and dependencies for the frontend application.
